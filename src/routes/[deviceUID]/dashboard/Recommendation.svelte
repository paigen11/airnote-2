		pollution, limit activity near idling cars and buses and near busy roads, especially during rush

		When particle pollution levels are high outdoors, they can be high indoors â€“ unless your
		building has a good filtration system. You can help keep your indoor particle levels low by:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Eliminating tobacco smoke</li>
		<li>Reducing your use of wood stoves and fireplaces</li>
		<li>Using HEPA air filters and air cleaners designed to reduce particles</li>
	</ul>
